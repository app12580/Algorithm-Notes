### description    
  Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.  
    
  String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.  
    
  Find the letter that was added in t.  
    
  Example:  
    
  Input:  
  s = "abcd"  
  t = "abcde"  
    
  Output:  
  e  
    
  Explanation:  
  'e' is the letter that was added.  
### solution    
```    
  class Solution {  
      public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {  
          int res = 0;  
          for(char ch: s.toCharArray()) {  
              res ^= ch;  
          }  
          for(char ch: t.toCharArray()) {  
              res ^= ch;  
          }  
          return (char)res;  
      }  
  }  
```    
    
### 个人解读    
  因为全是小写字母，所以和int的异或操作类似。
