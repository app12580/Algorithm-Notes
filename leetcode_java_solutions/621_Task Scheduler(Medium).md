### description    
  Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.  
    
  However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.  
    
  You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.  
    
     
    
  Example:  
    
  Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2  
  Output: 8  
  Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.  
     
    
  Note:  
    
  The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].  
  The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

                         max = counter[task - 'A'];  
                         maxCount = 1;  
                     }  
                 }  
                   
                 int partCount = max - 1;  
                 int partLength = n - (maxCount - 1);  
                 int emptySlots = partCount * partLength;  
                 int availableTasks = tasks.length - max * maxCount;  
                 int idles = Math.max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);  
                   
                 return tasks.length + idles;  
             }  
  }

### 个人解读    
  本题目思路中想到的一个可能性，要不要遍历，要不要回溯。  
    
  本题其实最终要的就是如何建立数学模型，  首先冷却时间n可以看做是一个长度为n的桶，然后每次都往里面装任务，并且任务不能重复。  
  本题目遍历的地方就在于共享同一个CD，所以造就了便利。  
  思路一：贪心算法，每次都先把最多的任务塞进去。  
  阻碍有很多，如何安排，可以通过数学方法走捷径吗？如何去描述已经做好的安排？难道需要每一个流程都要重排序吗？

  ```  
  The key is to find out how many idles do we need.  
  Let's first look at how to arrange them. it's not hard to figure out that we can do a "greedy arrangement": always arrange task with most frequency first.  
  E.g. we have following tasks : 3 A, 2 B, 1 C. and we have n = 2. According to what we have above, we should first arrange A, and then B and C. Imagine there are "slots" and we need to arrange tasks by putting them into "slots". Then A should be put into slot 0, 3, 6 since we need to have at least n = 2 other tasks between two A. After A put into slots, it looks like this:  
    
  A ? ? A ? ? A  
  "?" is "empty" slots.  
    
  Now we can use the same way to arrange B and C. The finished schedule should look like this:  
    
  A B C A B # A  
  "#" is idle  
    
  Now we have a way to arrange tasks. But the problem only asks for number of CPU intervals, so we don't need actually arrange them. Instead we only need to get the total idles we need and the answer to problem is just number of idles + number of tasks.  
  Same example: 3 A, 2 B, 1 C, n = 2. After arranging A, we have:  
  A ? ? A ? ? A  
  We can see that A separated slots into (count(A) - 1) = 2 parts, each part has length n. With the fact that A is the task with most frequency, it should need more idles than any other tasks. In this case if we can get how many idles we need to arrange A, we will also get number of idles needed to arrange all tasks. Calculating this is not hard, we first get number of parts separated by A: partCount = count(A) - 1; then we can know number of empty slots: emptySlots = partCount * n; we can also get how many tasks we have to put into those slots: availableTasks = tasks.length - count(A). Now if we have emptySlots > availableTasks which means we have not enough tasks available to fill all empty slots, we must fill them with idles. Thus we have idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);  
  Almost done. One special case: what if there are more than one task with most frequency? OK, let's look at another example: 3 A 3 B 2 C 1 D, n = 3  
  Similarly we arrange A first:  
  A ? ? ? A ? ? ? A  
  Now it's time to arrange B, we find that we have to arrange B like this:  
  A B ? ? A B ? ? A B  
  we need to put every B right after each A. Let's look at this in another way, think of sequence "A B" as a special task "X", then we got:  
  X ? ? X ? ? X  
  Comparing to what we have after arranging A:  
  A ? ? ? A ? ? ? A  
  The only changes are length of each parts (from 3 to 2) and available tasks. By this we can get more general equations:  
  partCount = count(A) - 1  
  emptySlots = partCount * (n - (count of tasks with most frequency - 1))  
  availableTasks = tasks.length - count(A) * count of tasks with most frenquency  
  idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks)  
  result = tasks.length + idles  
    
  What if we have more than n tasks with most frequency and we got emptySlot negative? Like 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, n = 2. In this case seems like we can't put all B C S inside slots since we only have n = 2.  
  Well partCount is actually the "minimum" length of each part required for arranging A. You can always make the length of part longer.  
  E.g. 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 2E, n = 2.  
  You can always first arrange A, B, C, D as:  
  A B C D | A B C D | A B C D  
  in this case you have already met the "minimum" length requirement for each part (n = 2), you can always put more tasks in each part if you like:  
  e.g.  
  A B C D E | A B C D E | A B C D  
    
  emptySlots < 0 means you have already got enough tasks to fill in each part to make arranged tasks valid. But as I said you can always put more tasks in each part once you met the "minimum" requirement.  
    
  To get count(A) and count of tasks with most frequency, we need to go through inputs and calculate counts for each distinct char. This is O(n) time and O(26) space since we only handle upper case letters.  
  All other operations are O(1) time O(1) space which give us total time complexity of O(n) and space O(1)

  注意除了模型的建立外，对于负数的处理方式也需要学习。

                   int max = 0;             //出现的最多次数是多少次  
                   int maxCount = 0;        //对于出现的最次数，有多少个重复的

                   //max: 3 maxCount:1  
                   int partCount = max - 1;             //根据最多次数，划分成多少取余 2  
                   int partLength = n - (maxCount - 1);     //需要根据重复次数的多少，根据建模，减小空隙n的大小。 2  
                   int emptySlots = partCount * partLength;     //A??A??A 里面?的长度， 可能为负数  2 * 2 = 4  
                   int availableTasks = tasks.length - max * maxCount;  //除了最多次数的任务，剩下的有多少个 6- 3*1=3 (BBC)  
                   int idles = Math.max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);   //空闲的次数，如果是负数，则为0   4-3=1  
                     
                   return tasks.length + idles;  
               }  
    }
